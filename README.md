PacmanPvP is a 1v1v1v1 multiplyer remake of the classic game Pacman

##
Like classic Pacman, the player can collect points and eat ghosts. Each dot is worth 10 points. Collecting a fruit will give the player the ability to catch ghosts for 15 seconds. While the player has the power-up, the top right corner displays "INVINCIBILITY ON". Each ghost the player touches with invincibility will die and reward 100 points. Ghosts will respawn after a certain time to ensure the game stays interesting.
##
The game starts when all four players load in. If an enemy ghost touches the player or if their ghosts run out, the player is out. Once all the dots are collected or everyone dies, the game ends with the winner being the person with the most points! There is also a single player version in case you have no friends.

## Setup
The server needs to be running first and always be running in the background. You need to adjust the IP address in the files depending on the IP address of the server you are running it on. After starting the server, start up instances of the client. Once all four players load in, the game starts. Have fun!!
